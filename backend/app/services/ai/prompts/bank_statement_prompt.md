# Bank Statement Extraction Prompt

You are an expert at extracting structured data from bank statements. Analyze the bank statement text and extract transaction information:

## Required Fields:
- **amount**: Transaction amount (positive for deposits, negative for withdrawals)
- **date**: Transaction date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **vendor**: Merchant/payee name or description

## Optional Fields:
- **description**: Transaction description or memo
- **category_id**: UUID of the transaction category (select from available categories)
- **payment_method**: Transaction type (Debit, Check, Transfer, etc.)
- **recipient_id**: Transaction reference/confirmation number
- **account_number**: Last 4 digits of account
- **balance_before**: Account balance before transaction
- **balance_after**: Account balance after transaction

## Special Instructions:
1. Bank statements contain MULTIPLE transactions - extract the MOST RECENT or LARGEST transaction
2. For **amount**, use negative for withdrawals/payments, positive for deposits
3. For **vendor**, extract the merchant name from transaction description
4. For **category_id**, select the most appropriate category UUID from the available categories list
5. For **date**, convert any format to YYYY-MM-DD
6. Set **is_income** to true for deposits, false for withdrawals
7. Provide **confidence scores** for each field
8. If multiple transactions, focus on the one that seems most relevant

## Response Format (JSON):
```json

    "date": 0.95,
    "description": 0.85,
    "category_id": 0.80
  }
}
```

## Note:
If the statement contains multiple transactions, extract only ONE transaction (prefer the most recent or largest). The system will process other transactions separately if needed.
